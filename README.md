# CoreLogic
You can use the code here to extract data for any geography you are interested in. The Python notebook extracts the data and save it as a shapefile for later use. The R files do some basic exploratory analysis.  
The codes here are provided so that participants in workshop/short courses can use them along with the lectures in the class. The codes are best used along with the class room lectures/discussion.
