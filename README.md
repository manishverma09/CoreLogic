# CoreLogic
The University of Michigan library system has licensed a large data set containing real estate transactions, deeds, and property tax records for the United States. The data were collected by the commercial vendor Corelogic https://www.corelogic.com/, and our license allows UM researchers to use the data for research purposes. These data are of potential interest to researchers in many fields, as they capture spatial and temporal real estate market conditions, taxing practices, and the physical states of millions of residential structures in the US. The data include point location of each property. 

You can use the code here to extract data for any geography you are interested in. The Python notebook extracts the data and saves it as a shapefile for later use. The R files read the shapefile, attach some information from Census, and do basic exploratory analysis. You will need a Census API key to access and download the census data. 

The codes here are provided so that participants in the workshop can use them along with the lectures in the class. The codes are best used along with the workshop discussion, but if you might find it useful if you are trying to subset CoreLogic data.
